# Team Meeting - January 2026

## Attendees
- Alice (Lead Developer)
- Bob (Research Scientist)
- Carol (Product Manager)

## Discussion Points

### Hybrid Search Implementation
We discussed the integration of BM25 and vector search using Reciprocal Rank Fusion. The team agreed that this approach provides the best balance between keyword precision and semantic recall.

### Local File Integration
Carol suggested adding support for local Markdown and text files to enable search across personal notes and Obsidian vaults. This would make the tool more useful for researchers and knowledge workers.

### Next Steps
- Complete the LocalFileIndexer implementation
- Add comprehensive documentation
- Create demo videos for users

## Action Items
- Alice: Implement multi-source search
- Bob: Benchmark hybrid search performance
- Carol: Write user documentation
