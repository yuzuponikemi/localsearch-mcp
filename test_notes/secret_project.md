# Project DeepBlue

Project DeepBlue is a secret AI research initiative developed in 2025. This project aims to create advanced hybrid search capabilities combining both traditional keyword matching and modern semantic understanding.

## Key Features

- Multi-source knowledge integration
- Real-time indexing of personal documents
- Offline-first architecture
- Privacy-preserving search

## Technical Details

The project uses a composite pattern to merge results from multiple data sources, ensuring that both general knowledge (Wikipedia) and personal knowledge (local files) are seamlessly integrated.

## Research Goals

- Improve information retrieval for personal knowledge management
- Enable AI assistants to access both public and private knowledge
- Maintain complete data privacy by keeping everything local

This is a demonstration file for testing the multi-source search functionality.
